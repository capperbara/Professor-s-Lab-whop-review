## Understanding Sports Betting Legality

  

Before joining any betting community, you need to understand the legal landscape in your area.

  

Sports betting was largely illegal in the United States under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). Only Delaware, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon were exempted due to existing frameworks.

  

Everything changed in 2018 when the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. This opened the door for individual states to legalize sports betting.

  

**Current Legal Status:**

-   **37 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico** have operational legal sports betting
-   **30 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico** allow online sports betting
-   **8 states** only allow betting at physical sportsbooks
-   **North Carolina** has legalized but operations start later in 2024

  

Since 2018, over $20 billion has been wagered legally in the United States. The industry continues growing rapidly as more states come online.

  

**Important:** Always verify sports betting is legal in your specific jurisdiction before placing any wagers.
